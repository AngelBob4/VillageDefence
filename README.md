## Description
Have you ever dreamed of becoming a hero who saves the world from hordes of enemies? Now your dream can become a reality with the new "Village defence" game!

Each destroyed enemy brings you valuable points. Collect them to improve your place on the leaderboard. Become stronger, faster and deadlier to face increasingly difficult waves of enemies.

## How to play
